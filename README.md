# 💫About Me :
**Full name**: Nguyễn Đặng Nhân
**Hobbies**: Math and coding
**Overview**: I am a high school student who loves to spend time learning about math and coding. I started exploring about Arduino when I was 13 and had a chance to get access to Python when I was 15. I want to develop my skills and go on learning about Artificial Intelligence, therefore, I would love to learn from any online sources that I can find.
